# What is an ER Model

An ER Model, or Entity Relationship Model, is a model for identifying entities to be represented in 
the database and representation of how those entities are related. 

The Entity Relationship Diagram explains the relationship among the entities present in the database. ER models are used to model real-world objects like a person, a car, or a company and the relation between these real-world objects. In short, the ER Diagram is the structural format of the database.
